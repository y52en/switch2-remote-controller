# Switch 2 Remote Controller

[日本語](README.ja.md)

An experimental remote controller built around an ESP32-C3. A browser sends
controller state to a local Node.js bridge, the bridge writes compact EasyCon
frames over USB Serial/JTAG, and the ESP32-C3 presents the controller to a
Nintendo Switch 2 over Bluetooth LE.

Cloudflare Worker: signaling and optional TURN credentials only
```

Controller input normally travels directly between browsers. The Cloudflare
Worker coordinates WebRTC setup and can provide TURN credentials; it does not
process the local USB connection.

## Supported hardware

- Generic ESP32-C3 boards with 4 MB flash and USB Serial/JTAG: headless profile.
- 2424S012C ESP32-C3 board with a 240x240 GC9A01 round LCD: optional LCD profile.
- A computer running Windows, macOS, or Linux with Node.js 24 and `uv`.

The headless build is the default and does not initialize the LCD SPI bus or
GPIOs. The 2424S012C display is already wired on-board as follows:

| GC9A01 signal | ESP32-C3 GPIO |
| --- | ---: |
| RST | 1 |
| DC | 2 |
| BL | 3 |
| SCK | 6 |
| MOSI | 7 |
| CS | 10 |

These pins are configured only by the LCD profile. Do not attach conflicting
peripherals when using that profile.

## Firmware

Install [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/), then run:

```sh
uv sync --frozen
uv run --frozen python scripts/firmware.py build --profile headless
```

For the 2424S012C display build:

```sh
uv run --frozen python scripts/firmware.py build --profile lcd-2424s012c
```

Upload after replacing the port with your device path:

```sh
uv run --frozen python scripts/firmware.py upload --profile headless --port COM3
```

Use `/dev/ttyACM0` on many Linux systems or `/dev/cu.usbmodem*` on macOS. The
upload command verifies that the selected device is an ESP32-C3 before writing.
PlatformIO and the patched ESP-IDF package are isolated under `.cache`.

## Host application

```sh
npm ci
cp apps/host/.env.example apps/host/.env
# Edit ESP32_SERIAL_PORT in apps/host/.env
npm run start:host
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:8787`. The bridge accepts local WebSocket clients only,
reconnects the configured serial port, preserves digital button edges, and
sends neutral input when the controller page disconnects.

## Pairing

1. Flash either firmware profile and reconnect the ESP32-C3 with a USB data
   cable.
2. Start the host application and open its local URL.
3. Open the controller pairing screen on the Switch 2.
4. Press the on-screen or mapped **L** and **R** controls until the emulated
   controller appears, then complete pairing on the console.
5. Confirm buttons and sticks locally before creating a remote guest link.

Pairing data is saved in ESP32 flash. Keep the board powered and close the host
page before disconnecting the serial cable so the neutral-state safety path can
run.

## Remote access

```sh
npm run dev:signaling
```

For deployment, see [services/signaling/README.md](services/signaling/README.md).
TURN credentials must be stored with Wrangler secrets rather than committed to
the repository. The Worker configuration provides static assets, one Durable
Object binding named `ROOMS`, and optional `TURN_KEY_ID` / `TURN_KEY_API_TOKEN`
secrets. Controller input remains peer-to-peer even when signaling is deployed.

## Troubleshooting

- **Serial port is missing or rejected:** set `ESP32_SERIAL_PORT` in
  `apps/host/.env`; use Device Manager on Windows, `/dev/ttyACM*` on Linux, or
  `/dev/cu.*` on macOS. Linux users may also need serial-device group access.
- **Upload refuses the device:** the wrapper intentionally stops unless
  `esptool` identifies an ESP32-C3. Recheck the port and put the board in its
  bootloader mode if required by the board.
- **Controller is not discovered:** reopen the console pairing screen, power
  cycle the ESP32-C3, and check the serial diagnostics for BLE state changes.
- **LCD is blank:** build and upload `lcd-2424s012c`; the default headless image
  deliberately leaves its SPI bus and GPIOs untouched.
- **Remote guest cannot connect:** test on the same network first. Cross-NAT
  connections commonly require the TURN secrets described above.
- **Input returns to neutral:** this is expected after the host page disconnects
  or firmware receives no fresh input for 1.2 seconds.

## Verification

```sh
npm test
npm run check:signaling
uv run --frozen python scripts/check_public_tree.py
```

CI runs host tests on Windows, macOS, and Linux and builds both firmware
profiles on Linux. Hardware pairing, input, rumble, and watchdog behavior must
still be checked on a physical console before publishing a release binary.

## Safety and limitations

- Firmware clears queued input after 1.2 seconds without a fresh host frame.
- The host sends neutral state when its active controller page disconnects.
- BLE queue stalls and failed notifications have bounded recovery paths.
- ESP32-C3 support uses a non-standard 5 ms BLE interval and remains experimental.
